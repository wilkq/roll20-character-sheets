# TODO list

- Update sheet preview images

- General improvements to goal rolls
  - Add CSC and CFC to characteristic & skills rolls
  - Ability to switch b/w public vs GM roll
  - Vitality critical levels (-2 to -10) to affect goal numbers
  - Ensure a 1 is always a success, even when the goal number is < 0 due to a high malus

- Increase similarity to the official character sheet
  - add a section for Movement (default: 5)
  - add a section for Languages

- [TBC] use short names for characteristics in weapon/psi/theurgy tables to save up on space

- ability for users to report a bug found in the sheet

- Weapons & armors property checkboxes (Shock, Laser, Plasma, etc..) & replace d6rolls with proper damage/armor rolls showing shield-piercing vs normal damage, etc.

- Support for Symbiot characters

# Nice-to-have
- Infoboxes, e.g. how to compute init, wyrd, vita...

- xp changes lead to traits updates or vice versa (characs, skills, derived ones like vita, wyrd, init)

- Fading Suns Logo

- Sheet for spaceships
